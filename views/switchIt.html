<!-- Description -->
<div class="sub-content">
  <h3 class= "sub-title">Description</h3>
  <p class="paragraph class="paragraph" ">Inspired by fun and fast phone games like Candy Crush, MonsterBusters, or Bejeweled that people love to play for a fun distraction and a simple brain stretch!
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph" >
  All game pieces are present and visible at the beginning of the game. The player must reorganize the pieces so they match along an entire row or column to get points!
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph" >
  Reorganization is achieved in one way: Switch your key piece (top left piece in its own box) with any piece on the board.

      <h4 class="approach-h">WHAT</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p class="paragraph">I went for a clean look and feel UI-wise, and focused on making a game that can progress and grow with the user.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Some cool features are:</p>
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>Dynamically created gameArray and HTML board</li>
        <li>Multiple Levels with different size boards</li>
        <li>Ability to add levels and monsters easily in an object array and have the game include them automatically.</li>

      <h4 class="approach-h">WHY</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p class="paragraph">From the beginning, my goal was to create a game with a dynamic game board that was able to reform depending on the level requirements.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2 div-h">
      <h4 class="approach-h">HOW</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p class="paragraph">I avoided hardcoding variables and elements and set the game up to be easily scalable by pointing all my code to objects and object arrays that store information about each level.</p>
