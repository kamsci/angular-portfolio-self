  <h3 class="sub-title">Description</h3>

  <p class="paragraph">This app is a fun take on a common industry process: inventory tracking. Instead of creating the standard shopping cart experience, I experimented with a slightly different concept: borrowing and lending inventory among friends.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
  The idea is you and your friends all own various toys, tools, gagets, and media that you would be willing to lend to each other. This app is a place for you to keep inventory of all those items you would lend to a freind or could borrow from a friend. Each user can see items they can borrow separate from items they lend, or items they already have borrowed. I purposely did not include contact info in the first iteration for privacy reasons and because, as friends, you would already have their contact info.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
  In order to make the process easier to showcase in a portfolio, I decided not to include user authentication. If I were to release this product to actually be used, I would create a second app for production and add user authentication and profiles.

<!-- The Approach -->

  <h3 class="sub-title">The Approach</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2 div-h">
      <h4 class="approach-h">WHAT</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p class="paragraph">The goal was to separate frontend action and activity from the back end. Angular is all front end, talking to Node and Express on the backend, which in turn talks to a SQL/Postgresql database.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Some cool features are:</p>
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>Ability to add items attached to a specific user and the user can edit and delete their items</li>
        <li>User can see items they can borrow separate from items they lend, or items they already have borrowed.</li>
        <li>A user can select a friend to lend their item to and the freind's name will appear as the 'borrower' with the current date.</li>
        <li>Nested Angular Views</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2">
      <h4 class="approach-h">WHY</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p class="paragraph">When thinking about coding from a DRY, RESTfull, and MVC perspective, you want to have clear roles for each tool and not allow bleeding over. Express doesn't do any frontend routing, and Angular doesn't talk to the database. This project was an exersice in making the very front (HTML) talk to the very backend (DB) through the proper use of appropriate channels. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <p class="paragraph"> Introducing... the PEAN stack. Postgresql - Express - Angular - Node.js with Gulp on the side for easy developer expansion.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Views are set up in Angular for page navigation and display of content. Angualr talks to Express.js through $http calls. Express routes are purely to take request from angular and retrieve and calculate data from the backend. All express routes start in the root folder followed by "/api/" to identify them as non-front end views.</p>
